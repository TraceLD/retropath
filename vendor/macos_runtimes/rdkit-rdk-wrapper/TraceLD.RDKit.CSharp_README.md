C# Wrapper for the RDKit C++ cheminformatics library with support for Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Usage

- Create a new .NET project targeting `net6.0`.
- [Add the package from nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TraceLD.RDKit.CSharp/).
- Build your project.
- Hopefully everything works ðŸ™‚ (assuming you're running on a supported system).

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/TraceLD/TraceLD.RDKit.CSharp/tree/main/examples) for example project(s).

## Currently supported operating systems

### Windows

- Supports Windows 10 x86 and x64 and Windows 11 x64.
- Tested on Win 10 and Win 11 21H2 (OS Build 22000.613).

### Linux

- Supports x64 Linux.
- Currently tested distros:
  - Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye): 5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2
  - Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS: 5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2
  - Other distros *should* work but you might find some packages need to first be installed.
    - I will be testing (and adding support for, if changes are needed) the package on more distros as time permits.

### macOS

 - Supports ARM64 (Apple Silicon) Monterey.
 - I sadly do not own an Intel Mac to be able to provide x64 binaries and test them.
   - I will look into GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines in the future for this but can't guarantee success.
